# SQL-Portfolios

This is a basic level portfolio project which is completed using Agrregate functions, Joints, Subquries and a Window Function.

You can use the given data and run the Quries to get exact results which are mentioned as a header of each querry.

Tables are created by uploading Excel files directly in MicroSoft_SQL Server.

I used the same name as the name of the files while creating the tables.
