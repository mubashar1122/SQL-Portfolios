# SQL-Portfolios

There are different data files with their own sql code. The name of the code and data files are same. 

These are a basic level portfolio projects that are completed using Agrregate functions, Joints, Subqueries and Window Functions.

You can use the given data and run the quries to get exact results which are mentioned as a header of each querry.

Tables are created by uploading Excel files directly in MicroSoft_SQL Server.

I used the same name, as the name of the files, while creating the tables.
